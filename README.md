Sprocket
========
A queue-based library for FRC robots, coded in LabVIEW 2015.

Part boilerplate, part library, **Sprocket** is intended to handle features
such as autonomous sequencing, manual / semi-auto controls and ... TODO.

Zero dependencies, but designed for interoperability with the LabVIEW WPI Robotics Library.

# Motivation
For seven years, Huskie Robotics has built its software from scratch for every
FRC build season.

For seven years, we have grappled with rising code complexity, and last-minute additions to our robot.

Last year, our behemoth three-tote autonomous for the 2015 Recycle Rush game hooked into every subsystem of our robot. We hacked it together with notifiers
and error-wire execution flow, and it was a sprawling mess.

(insert autonomous picture here)

**Sprocket** is an attempt to break the cycle of complexity. By condensing
complex event sequencing into queues, we hope to make autonomous,
semi-auto, and teleoperated actions more modular and more easily extensible.

# Getting Started

We have two versions of our library:
- **sprocket-r** - targeting the NI roboRIO
- **sprocket-c** - targeting the NI cRIO-FRC II (4-slot).

The NI cRIO-FRC (8-slot) controller is not supported.

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://www.github.com/HuskieRobotics/sprocket/releases).

Unzip and you're ready to start building your swerve drive forklift.

Our library is organized into four main sections:

- Input - gather joystick input, transform into actions
- Sensor - gather sensor input
- Delegate - directing actions to separate subsystems
- Subsystem - calculate and perform subsystem actions

These three sections are organized into four VIs derived from the
auto-generated FRC robot project:
- Input -> Teleop.vi
- Sensor -> Sensor.vi (under Periodic Tasks.vi)
- Delegate -> Delegate.vi (under Periodic Tasks.vi)
- Subsystem logic -> Periodic Tasks.vi

With the following VIs intended for particular uses:
- Begin.vi - initializing motor controllers, actuators, sensors and queues
- Autonomous Independent.vi - sequencing autonomous actions
- Disabled.vi - stop all actuators / avert disaster

Vision processing is unsupported, but should be similar to Input.

# Documentation
API documentation hosted (hopefully) on [Github Pages](HuskieRobotics.github.io/sprocket).

Each VI has been (hopefully) painstakingly documented with context help and
comments for both users and contributors.

# Terminology

- Joystick - anything used to input human commands to the robot, be they
  gamepads or actual joysticks
- Driver - the human manning the joysticks

- Subsystem - portion of robot that can act independently

- Autonomous - fully independent robot actions without any driver input.
  Refers specifically to the autonomous period during FRC matches.
- Teleoperated (Teleop) - direct driver actions inputted through the joysticks.
- Semi-auto - sequenced actions occurring after a sequenced button input.
  Often used for automating complex tasks, or for things that depend on sensor
  checks.
